# PCILeech TUI Security & Validation Enhancements

This document outlines the security and validation enhancements implemented in the PCILeech TUI application to improve input validation and privilege management.

## Overview

The security enhancements focus on two main areas:

1. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs, including file paths, PCI BDF identifiers, and configuration values.
2. **Privilege Management**: Improved handling of operations that require elevated privileges (root access).

These enhancements help protect the application from invalid inputs and ensure operations requiring privileged access are handled securely and gracefully.

## Input Validation

### Implementation Details

The input validation system is implemented in `src/tui/utils/input_validator.py` and provides comprehensive validation for various types of inputs:

- **File paths**: Validates file existence and type
- **Directory paths**: Validates directory existence, type, and write permissions
- **PCI BDF identifiers**: Validates format (XXXX:XX:XX.X)
- **Non-empty values**: Ensures required fields are provided
- **Numeric values**: Validates numeric inputs and ranges
- **Enumerated options**: Validates inputs against allowed choices
- **Configuration validation**: Validates complete configuration objects

### Integration Points

The input validator is integrated at key points in the application:

1. **Build Configuration**: Configuration validation in `build_operations.py` now uses the InputValidator to thoroughly validate all configuration parameters before starting a build.
2. **Device Selection**: BDF validation ensures valid device identifiers are used.
3. **File Path Inputs**: All file path inputs are validated for existence and proper type.

### Benefits

- Prevents errors caused by invalid inputs
- Provides clear, specific error messages for users
- Centralizes validation logic for consistency
- Improves code maintainability by separating validation from business logic

## Privilege Management

### Implementation Details

The privilege management system is implemented in `src/tui/utils/privilege_manager.py` and provides:

- **Privilege Detection**: Automatically detects if the application is running with root privileges
- **Sudo Availability**: Checks if sudo is available for privilege elevation
- **Permission Requests**: Provides an interface for requesting elevated privileges
- **Dialog Integration**: Includes a UI dialog for requesting user permission before elevating privileges
- **Command Execution**: Simplifies running commands with elevated privileges

### Integration Points

The privilege manager is integrated at key points requiring elevated access:

1. **VFIO Operations**: In `vfio_handler.py`, VFIO binding operations now request privileges when needed
2. **Device Scanning**: Scanning PCI devices gracefully handles insufficient privileges
3. **Build Process**: Build operations that modify system files request appropriate privileges

### Benefits

- Provides graceful degradation when privileges are unavailable
- Avoids unexpected permission errors during operations
- Improves security by requesting privileges only when needed
- Enhances user experience with clear permission dialogs
- Simplifies privilege-related code throughout the application

## Testing

Comprehensive tests for both systems are available in `tests/tui/test_security_features.py`, which includes:

- Tests for all validation methods
- Tests for privilege detection and elevation
- Mock testing of privileged operations

## Usage Examples

### Input Validation

```python
# Validate a file path
is_valid, error = InputValidator.validate_file_path(file_path)
if not is_valid:
    # Handle error with clear message
    notify(error, severity="error")
    return

# Validate a BDF identifier
is_valid, error = InputValidator.validate_bdf(device_id)
if not is_valid:
    notify(error, severity="error")
    return
```

### Privilege Management

```python
# Check and request privileges for an operation
has_privileges = await privilege_manager.request_privileges("modify_system_files")
if not has_privileges:
    # Either notify user or try alternative approach
    notify("Insufficient privileges for system modification", severity="warning")
    # Continue with limited functionality
    
# Run a command with elevated privileges if needed
success, stdout, stderr = await privilege_manager.run_with_privileges(
    ["modprobe", "vfio-pci"], "load_kernel_modules"
)
```

## Conclusion

These security enhancements significantly improve the robustness of the PCILeech TUI application by:

1. Preventing errors and unexpected behavior from invalid inputs
2. Providing clear, helpful error messages to users
3. Handling privilege requirements gracefully
4. Improving code maintainability through centralized security components

The modular design of these components makes them easy to extend as new validation requirements or privileged operations are added to the application.
